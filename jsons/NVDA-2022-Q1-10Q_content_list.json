The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $\\$5$ billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $\\$1.5$ billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $\\$2$ billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $\\$1.36$ billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $\\$0.17$ billion and royalties of $\\$0.47$ billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $\\$1.25$ billion of the Signing Consideration. The Signing Consideration was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement.

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we believe Gaming benefited from cryptocurrency mining demand, although it is hard to determine to what extent. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and notebook workstation products, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects of the pandemic subside.
