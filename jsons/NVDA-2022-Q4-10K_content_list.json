Our  corporate  headquarters,  a  large  portion  of  our current  data  center  capacity,  and  a  portion  of  our  research  and  development  activities  are  located  in  California,  and  other  critical  business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.

The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown.

Our  domestic  and  international  tax liabilities  are  subject  to  the  allocation  of  revenue  and  expenses  in  different  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome  of  such  a  review  or  audit  could  increase  our  worldwide  effective  tax  rate,  increase  the  amount  of  non-income  taxes  imposed  on  our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations under the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize  research  and development  expenditures  and to  amortize  domestic  expenditures  over  five  years  and foreign  expenditures  over  fifteen years. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent proposals  to  increase  the  U.S.  corporate  income  tax  rate  or  impose  a  minimum  tax  on  financial  statement  income,  increase  U.S.  taxation  of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. Numerous countries, as well  as  organizations  such  as  the  OECD,  support  the  global  minimum  tax  initiative  and  are  considering  changes  to  existing  tax  laws  or  have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business, which could materially impact our results of operations.

GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us  to  estimate  with  any  reasonable  degree  of  precision  the  past  or  current  impact  of  cryptocurrency  mining,  or  forecast  the  future  impact  of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel,  and  may  reduce  demand  for  our  new  GPUs.  We  have  introduced  LHR  GeForce  GPUs  with  limited  Ethereum  mining  capability  and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our desired outcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both  a  global  and  regional  basis.  In  estimating  demand  and  evaluating  trends,  we  make  multiple  assumptions,  any  of  which  may  prove  to  be incorrect. ",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who  they  named  as  defendants  violated  Section  20(a)  of  the  Exchange  Act.  Plaintiffs  sought  class  certification,  an  award  of  unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just  and proper.  On March  2,  2021,  the district  court  granted  NVIDIA’s  motion  to dismiss  the  complaint  without  leave to amend,  entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case.
