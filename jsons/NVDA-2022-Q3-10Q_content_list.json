The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

GPUs can be used for cryptocurrency mining, though we do not have visibility into how much of our GPU usage is for cryptocurrency mining nor the future demand for GPUs to mine cryptocurrency. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, changes in government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. There have been aftermarket attempts to increase the Ethereum mining capability of our LHR cards. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects of the pandemic subside.

        "text": "Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast demand. To have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for  our  customers,  we  may  build  finished  products  and  maintain  in  inventory  for  anticipated  periods  of  growth  which  do  not  occur,  anticipating demand that does not materialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we have placed and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums and/or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply and capacity. Ordering product in advance of our normal lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long term demand for our products or if such demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our financial results. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may disappear. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, and transitions, competitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have many use cases including their intended marketed use case and other uses. For example, GPUs can be used for digital currency mining, though we do not have visibility into how much of our GPU usage is for cryptocurrency nor the past or future demand for GPU usage in cryptocurrency mining. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, changes in government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact cryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and  may  also  create  increased  aftermarket  resales  of  our  GPUs,  impact  retail  prices  for  our  GPUs,  increase  returns  of  our  products  in  the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Although we have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability  in  order  to  address  demand  from  gamers,  if  attempts  in  the  aftermarket  to  improve  the  hash  rate  capabilities  of  our  LHR  cards  are successful, our gaming cards may become attractive to miners and increase demand for our GPUs, and therefore exacerbate our ability to supply our  cards  to  gamers  or  other  customers.  Additionally,  consumer  and  enterprise  behavior  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  such  as  increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.

For example, extreme heat in Northern California combined with concerns about wildfire risk have led to, and in the future may lead to, several prolonged power safety shut offs that have had, and in the future may have, adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter operations. Severe weather events such as these may impair the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions. In addition, one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. ",

Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including manufacturing costs such as costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Furthermore, while we have endeavored to provide transparency by disclosing our environmental, social and governance efforts, it is possible that if we are deemed by one or more stakeholder groups to be insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change to our business or insufficiently forthcoming about our practices, we could face legal action or reputational harm. For example, we may not achieve our goal to source $65\\%$ of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal, which could affect our business and financial condition in an adverse manner. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs. ",
