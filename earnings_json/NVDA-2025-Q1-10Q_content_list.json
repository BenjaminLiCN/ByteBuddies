The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel\u2019s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate pending NVIDIA\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. Four amicus briefs in support of NVIDIA\u2019s petition were filed on April 5, 2024. ",

We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue.

The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China.

We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming.

In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. ",

Korean residents are not permitted to sell foreign securities (including shares of Common Stock) through nonKorean brokers or deposit funds resulting from the sale of shares of Common Stock in an account with an overseas financial institution. If you wish to sell shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, you may be required to transfer the shares of Common Stock to a domestic investment broker in Korea and to effect the sale through such broker. You are solely responsible for engaging the domestic broker in Korea, and non-compliance with the requirement to sell shares of Common Stock through a domestic broker can result in significant penalties. However, on December 29, 2023, the Korean Financial Services Commission issued an advance notice of legislative action which, if adopted as drafted, would allow Korean residents to dispose of overseas-listed securities (including shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan) without using a Korean licensed broker and deposit proceeds from the sale with an overseas financial institution. Until the legislation is adopted, the restrictions described above remain applicable to foreign-listed securities, including the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan. You should consult with your personal advisor regarding any regulatory obligations in connection with your participation in the Plan. ",

Korean residents are not permitted to sell foreign securities (including shares of Common Stock) through nonKorean brokers or deposit funds resulting from the sale of shares of Common Stock in an account with an overseas financial institution. If you wish to sell shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, you may be required to transfer the shares of Common Stock to a domestic investment broker in Korea and to effect the sale through such broker. You are solely responsible for engaging the domestic broker in Korea, and non-compliance with the requirement to sell shares of Common Stock through a domestic broker can result in significant penalties. However, on December 29, 2023, the Korean Financial Services Commission issued an advance notice of legislative action which, if adopted as drafted, would allow Korean residents to dispose of overseas-listed securities (including shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan) without using a Korean licensed broker and deposit proceeds from the sale with an overseas financial institution. Until the legislation is adopted, the restrictions described above remain applicable to foreign-listed securities, including the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan. You should consult with your personal advisor regarding any regulatory obligations in connection with your participation in the Plan. ",
