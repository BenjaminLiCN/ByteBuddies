If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $\\$5$ billion in cash or up to an additional 41.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $\\$1.5$ billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $\\$2$ billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $\\$1.36$ billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $\\$0.17$ billion and royalties of $\\$0.47$ billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and the expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm\u2019s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are working through the regulatory process in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China  and  other  jurisdictions.  Although  some  Arm  licensees  have  expressed  concerns  or  objected  to  the  transaction,  and  discussions  with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal rationale and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition  to  Arm,  its  licensees,  and  the  industry.  If  the  Purchase  Agreement  is  terminated  under  certain  circumstances,  we  will  be  refunded $\\$1.25$ billion  of  the  Signing  Consideration.  The  Signing  Consideration  was  allocated  on  a  fair  value  basis  and  any  refund  of  the  Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. ",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

Plaintiffs  sought  class  certification,  an  award  of  unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just  and proper.

For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining.  Demand  and  use  of  GPUs  for  cryptocurrency  has  fluctuated  in  the  past  and  is  likely  to  continue  to  change  quickly.  Volatility  in  the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Government cryptocurrency policies and regulations may also impact the demand for our products. We have introduced Low Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to direct GeForce to gamers and CMP to miners. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, over $80\\%$ of our Ampere architecture-based GeForce GPU shipments in the quarter were LHR GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis if and when the effects  of  the  pandemic  subside.  In  estimating  demand  and  evaluating  trends,  we  make  multiple  assumptions,  any  of  which  may  prove  to  be incorrect. ",

These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks  have  occurred  on  our  systems  in  the  past  and  are  expected  to  occur  in  the  future.  Experienced  computer  programmers,  hackers  and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. We have completed our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, and concluded that there was no adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee  with  access  to  our  systems.  To  defend  against  security  threats,  both  to  our  internal  systems  and  those  of  our  customers,  we  must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.

Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
