The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10, 2022. ",

For example, many years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum.

Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and reduce demand for our new GPUs.

Our channel partners reduced their inventory and are transitioning to a lower value mix of inventory to better align with demand as well as an architectural transition, and we implemented pricing programs with them to address challenging market conditions that we expect to persist into the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The sequential decline in Gaming revenue also resulted from the war in Ukraine impacting sales in Europe and lockdowns in China due to COVID-19. The extent to which reduced cryptocurrency mining contributed to the decline in Gaming demand is difficult for us to reasonably quantify. Economic conditions in China drove lower sales to China hyperscale customers, impacting our Data Center revenue, and drove lower sales of Gaming products. We and our customers are also experiencing Data Center supply chain disruptions as our customers delay purchases pending the availability of other third party components. These recent reductions in demand and our reduced expectations of future demand have required us to record charges for excess inventory on hand and on order, and cancellation and underutilization penalties.
